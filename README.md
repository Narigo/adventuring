# Adventuring

Let's see Point & Click adventures in browsers.

TODO:
* Frontend
* Utility functions for actions (like picking up, open/close, etc)

Puzzles can be done by combining items.

## Building and testing

### Build

To build the examples, use `npm run build:examples`. It will create an `out` directory with an index file that shows 
all available examples.

### Testing

To test the current code use `npm test` for a single run of testing. For development, you can use `npm run test:watch`.
